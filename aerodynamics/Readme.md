Here Potential flow theory is used on 2D wing profile NACA0012 (airfoil) to determine the flow characteristics. The potential flow theory is a mathematical framework used to describe fluid flow in which the fluid is assumed to be inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational. These assumptions simplify the equations of motion, making them amenable to analytical solutions. In potential flow theory, fluid flow is described by a scalar potential function, known as the velocity potential, which satisfies Laplace's equation. The velocity field can then be obtained by taking the gradient of the velocity potential.

It is important to note that the potential flow theory is an approximation that neglects the effects of viscosity and turbulence, which can significantly affect the flow behavior in real-world applications. However, potential flow theory provides a useful and insightful tool for analyzing fluid flow around airfoils, and it is widely used in aerospace engineering for preliminary design and analysis. As is done in this module.
