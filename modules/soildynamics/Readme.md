# Soildynamics

Here we deal with linear solid-mechanics governed by a system of PDE modeling the deformation of elastic bodies. The solver, here is a 2D unstructured mesh linear elasticity solver for soildynamics, which uses FEM to search for vector solution of displacement unknown $\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2)$, since transient $\mathbf{u}$ changes with time.
